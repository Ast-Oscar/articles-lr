    <h2>Abstract / Texte source</h2><div class='box'><pre>Wireless sensor networks and Internet of Things devices are revolutionizing the smart agriculture industry by increasing production, sustainability, and profitability as connectivity becomes increasingly ubiquitous. However, the industry has become a popular target for cyberattacks. This survey investigates the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving cybersecurity in smart agriculture (SA). The relevant literature for the study was gathered from Nature, Wiley Online Library, MDPI, ScienceDirect, Frontiers, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, IGI Global, Springer, Taylor &amp; Francis, and Google Scholar. Of the 320 publications that fit the search criteria, 180 research papers were ultimately chosen for this investigation. The review described advancements from conventional agriculture to modern SA, including architecture and emerging technology. It digs into SA’s numerous uses, emphasizing its potential to transform farming efficiency, production, and sustainability. The growing reliance on SA introduces new cyber threats that endanger its integrity and dependability and provide a complete analysis of their possible consequences. Still, the research examined the essential role of AI in combating these threats, focusing on its applications in threat identification, risk management, and real-time response mechanisms. The survey also discusses ethical concerns such as data privacy, the requirement for high-quality information, and the complexities of AI implementation in SA. This study, therefore, intends to provide researchers and practitioners with insights into AI’s capabilities and future directions in the security of smart agricultural infrastructures. This study hopes to assist researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in harnessing AI for robust cybersecurity in SA, assuring a safe and sustainable agricultural future by comprehensively evaluating the existing environment and future trends. © 2024, Mesopotamian Academic Press.

    <h2>Abstract / Texte source</h2><div class='box'><pre>Cybersecurity management plays a key role in preserving the operational security of nuclear power plants (NPPs), ensuring service continuity and system resilience. The growing number of sophisticated cyber-attacks against NPPs requires cybersecurity experts to detect, analyze, and defend systems and data from cyber threats in near real time. However, managing a large numbers of attacks in a timely manner is impossible without the support of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study recognizes the need for a structured and in-depth analysis of the literature in the context of NPPs, referring to the role of AI technology in supporting cyber risk assessment processes. For this reason, a systematic literature review (SLR) is adopted to address the following areas of analysis: (i) critical assets to be preserved from cyber-attacks through AI, (ii) security vulnerabilities and cyber threats managed using AI, (iii) cyber risks and business impacts that can be assessed by AI, and (iv) AI-based security countermeasures to mitigate cyber risks. The SLR procedure follows a macro-step approach that includes review planning, search execution and document selection, and document analysis and results reporting, with the aim of providing an overview of the key dimensions of AI-based cybersecurity in NPPs. The structured analysis of the literature allows for the creation of an original tabular outline of emerging evidence (in the fields of critical assets, security vulnerabilities and cyber threats, cyber risks and business impacts, and AI-based security countermeasures) that can help guide AI-based cybersecurity management in NPPs and future research directions. From an academic perspective, this study lays the foundation for understanding and consciously addressing cybersecurity challenges through the support of AI; from a practical perspective, it aims to assist managers, practitioners, and policymakers in making more informed decisions to improve the resilience of digital infrastructure. © 2025 by the authors.</pre></div>

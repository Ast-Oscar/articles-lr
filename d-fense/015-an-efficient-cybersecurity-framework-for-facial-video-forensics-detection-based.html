    <h2>Abstract / Texte source</h2><div class='box'><pre>In cloud services and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, the cybersecurity in video transmission technologies has drawn much attention in recent researches due to the rapid growth of cyber-risks on both individuals and institutions. Unfortunately, the spoofing attack, a kind of cyber-risk, has increased the number of cyber-criminals in data transfer applications without being detected, especially in smart cities. Several applications based on online video communications, such as online testing and video conferences, are involved in smart cities. The video displays various variations of a person, which makes face recognition an important concept in security implementation. The face spoofing attacks are mainly based on the person&#x27;s face replication by replaying a video or by printed photos. Therefore, video forgery detection and related spoof attack detection have become a new topic in cybersecurity research. From this perspective, this paper presents a deep learning approach for video face forensic detection with a cyber facial spoofing attack using two methodologies. The first methodology is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the input video frames. The model has five convolutional layers followed by five pooling layers. The second methodology is based on convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM). This model comprises two pooling layers, two convolutional layers, and a convolutional LSTM layer. Each methodology includes a fully-connected layer to interconnect between the feature map resulting from the feature extraction process and the classification layer. A SoftMax layer performs the classification task in each method. This paper aims to achieve an optimum modality for face forensic detection to overcome spoofing attacks. Simulation results reveal that the ConvLSTM with CNN methodology achieves better classification results as the extracted features are more comprehensive than those of other conventional approaches. Also, it achieves an accuracy of 99%, and the works presented in the literature achieve an accuracy levels up to 95%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.</pre></div>

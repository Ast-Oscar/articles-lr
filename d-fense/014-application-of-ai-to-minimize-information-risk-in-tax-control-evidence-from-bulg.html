    <h2>Abstract / Texte source</h2><div class='box'><pre>The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in tax control is becoming more and more relevant in the conditions of globalization and digitalization of the economy, which creates a need for effective mechanisms for managing information risk. With the growing volume of data and the complexity of the tax processes, the risk of deviations, fraud and inconsistencies increases significantly. This article aims to examine applied AI tools and approaches that can minimize information risk in tax control, as well as to analyze their effectiveness through the prism of practice in Bulgaria. The methodology is based on correlation analysis, which measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between pairs of variables. A Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the variable &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; and the different forms of tax control. Kendall&#x27;s tau-b correlation coefficient was used to assess the linear relationship between the variables of collection, processing, verification, and management of tax information related to the application of AI. The main results show that AI has a positive and statistically significant effect on risk management and cybersecurity, suggesting the potential to improve data protection and reliability. However, the verification and revision of tax information needs to significantly impact AI, which points to the need for further development of these technologies for better integration. In conclusion, the application of AI offers significant opportunities to minimize information risk in tax control but requires targeted adaptation and refinement in specific aspects of control processes. © 2024 by the author.</pre></div>

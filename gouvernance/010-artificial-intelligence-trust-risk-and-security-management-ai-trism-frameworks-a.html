    <h2>Abstract / Texte source</h2><div class='box'><pre>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become pervasive, enabling transformative advancements in various industries including smart city, smart healthcare, smart manufacturing, smart virtual world and the Metaverse. However, concerns related to risk, trust, and security are emerging with the increasing reliance on AI systems. One of the most beneficial and original solutions for ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness of AI systems is AI Trust, Risk and Security Management (AI TRiSM) framework. Despite being comparatively new to the market, the framework has demonstrated already its effectiveness in various products and AI models. It has successfully contributed to fostering innovation, building trust, and creating value for businesses and society. Due to the lack of systematic investigations in AI TRiSM, we carried out a comprehensive and detailed review to bridge the existing knowledge gaps and provide a better understanding of the framework from both theoretical and technical standpoints. This paper explores various applications of the AI TRiSM framework across different domains, including finance, healthcare, and the Metaverse. Futhermore, the paper discusses the obstacles related to implementing AI TRiSM framework, including adversarial attacks, the constantly changing landscape of threats, ensuring regulatory compliance, addressing skill gaps, and acquiring expertise in the field. Finally, it explores the future directions of AI TRiSM, emphasizing the importance of continual adaptation and collaboration among stakeholders to address emerging risks and promote ethical and enhanced overall security bearing for AI systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd</pre></div>

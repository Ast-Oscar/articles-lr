    <h2>Abstract / Texte source</h2><div class='box'><pre>Fields such as machine learning and artificial intelligence are proven business enablers, we have several use cases in the field of technology from basic implementations such as automated scanners, and weak forms such as Alexa and Siri that have paved the way for further development. Search for more avenues of investment in this field continues till date. It&#x27;s also evident that researchers and organizations have barely scratched the surface in terms of exploring and using AI (Artificial intelligence) as a technology. Theoretical forms of AI have not yet been implemented. This paper aims to provide some context around the various forms of AI currently used and can be explored in the near future. It&#x27;s important to be mindful that, with the use of any technology, even AI, there are challenges, regulations, and security risks that tag along. Firms need to pay close attention to the macro factors that could impact the adoption and AI in their respective businesses. This study aims to provide a brief overview of the aforementioned road blocks that could impact AI adoption, however, there are some solution strategies or approaches that could help firms along the way to overcome those road blocks. These strategies might take time to build and take effect but they will be beneficial in the long run and thus help with not only sustainable implementation, but also complete and successful adoption of AI as a technology enabler. © 2013 IEEE.</pre></div>
